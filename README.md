Install packages:
The provided code snippet doesn't require any additional package installations. It uses standard libraries that come pre-installed with Python:

    os: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system (not used in this specific code).
    requests: Used for making HTTP requests (likely not installed by default).
    re: Used for regular expressions (pre-installed).
    urllib.parse: Provides functions for parsing URLs (pre-installed).

However, if you want to use the requests library, you'll need to install it first. Here's how:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Type the following command and press Enter:

      pip install requests

This will download and install the requests library for you.

Once you've installed requests, the rest of the code should work as intended.
